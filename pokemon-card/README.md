# Pokémon API Project

This project utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display data about Pokémon.

Users can explore various Pokémon, view their details, and learn more about their abilities, types, and other characteristics.

## Requirements

1. **Landing Page**: The web app includes a welcoming landing page to introduce users to the application.
2. **Pokémon List Page**: Browse through a collection of Pokémon, each displayed within a card with its name.
3. **Pokémon Details Page**: Click on individual Pokémon to view detailed information on a new page, including their sprite, name, abilities, types, stats, and height.

   **[Bonus]:** Provide the Pokémon forms in the details page as a subsection, each form should include the form name and sprite
   .

### Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS: For the structure and styling of the web pages.
- JavaScript: To handle interactions and dynamically update the content based on user actions.
